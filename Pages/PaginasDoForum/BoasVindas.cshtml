            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Blank1ll Network — a website created and developed by a solo developer: √ Blank1ll - [The Dev]</p>
            <p>Originally, this project started as a personal challenge — a way for me to learn how websites are built from the ground up.</p>
            <p>But along the way, it grew into something more meaningful. I wanted this to be more than just a project. I wanted it to become a real platform — something people could actually use and enjoy.</p>
            <p>Here, you can ask questions, share photos, videos, and messages — just like on a social network.</p>
            <p>In the future, this site will also support online courses shared by the community. It's still under development, but you're welcome to explore and be a part of it.</p>
            <p>If you're a user, enjoy your time here! If you're a recruiter or company representative, know that I'm still learning — but I work hard, and my dream is to work in tech professionally.</p>
            <p>Give me a chance, and I promise I'll make it worth your time. Thanks for visiting — and welcome to the Blank1ll Network!</p>
